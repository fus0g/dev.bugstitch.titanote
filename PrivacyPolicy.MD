**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the Titanote app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by BugStitch (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**Information Collection and Use**

The Application is completely offline and does not collect, transmit, or store any data outside of your device. All notes and data created in the Application are stored locally on your device and are only accessible to you. The Service Provider has no access to any data you create or store in the Application.

**Data Storage**

All data is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for backing up your data and maintaining the security of your device. If you uninstall the Application, all associated data will be permanently deleted from your device.

**Third Party Access**

The Application operates completely offline and does not integrate with or use any third-party services. No data is shared with any third parties.

**Deletion of Data**

You can delete all data stored by the Application by either:
- Deleting individual notes within the Application
- Clearing the Application's data through your device's settings
- Uninstalling the Application

**Children**

The Application does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The Application is a local note-taking tool that stores data only on the user's device.

**Security**

Since all data is stored locally on your device, security of your notes depends on your device's security. We recommend:
- Using device password/biometric protection
- Keeping your device's operating system updated
- Not rooting or jailbreaking your device
- Regularly backing up your important notes

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
