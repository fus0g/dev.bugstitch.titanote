**Terms & Conditions**

These terms and conditions apply to the Titanote app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by BugStitch (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service.

Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application at any time and for any reason. The Application is provided free of charge and is intended to remain free to use.

**Data Storage and Privacy**
The Application operates completely offline and stores all data locally on your device. No personal data is collected, transmitted, or shared with the Service Provider or any third parties. You are solely responsible for maintaining and backing up your data stored within the Application. The Service Provider cannot access any notes or information you create within the Application.

It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could compromise your phone's security features and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.

The Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged and that you maintain backups of your important data. If your device runs out of battery or if you lose data due to device malfunction, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.

The Service Provider may update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

**Changes to These Terms and Conditions**
The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-01-20
